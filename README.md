# NaviEngine v2.8
Welcome to Navi Engine!

The open source Pebble smartwatch PET Engine!

At the moment, we only support the pebble time, and pebble time steel.

But as it's now open source and I left some of the legacy code in, you may be able to port
it to the classic pebble with some work!

At the moment the code's a HUGE mess, as A lot of Test Code is left in,

and there are some parts that are 100% copied from tutorials, but it dose work!

You are FREE to use this in AS MANY WATCHFACES AS YOU WANT!

All I ask is that you give me some credit, and note what version of Navi Engine you used.
